  <p>So you’re thinking about throwing a couple schmeckles to RallySec. That’s cool, but I’d want to know what my hard earned schmeckles were going to before I tossed my precious few schmeckles into someone else’s hat. See <a href="https://rallysecurity.com/2019/06/18/Season1-Challenges.html#ef76ade3">our post here where we talk about challenges</a> we faced during season 1, as well as our goals, background on web hosting, as well as a transparency report on what season 1 money went towards.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To us, RallySec means being active in rallying our community members, helping recover and return to fighting the good fight. Each day brings news of more breaches, vulnerabilities, and bad news. Its easy to succumb to burn out, to get depressed and despondent, to feel hopeless. We wanted a place that we could lift up spirits and have a good time, as well as share knowledge and information with the community.</p>

<p>Before you throw money at us, <strong>please</strong> consider donating to one of the charities that we support.</p>

<h4 id="extra-life"><a href="https://www.extra-life.org/participant/360725">Extra Life</a>.</h4>

<iframe src="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=widgets.200x420thermo&amp;participantID=360725" width="202" height="422" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"><a href="https://www.extra-life.org/index.cfm?fuseaction=donorDrive.participant&amp;participantID=360725">Make a Donation!</a></iframe>

<p>Extra Life is a fundraising event, the proceeds of which go to branches of the Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals. 100% of all donations go directly to the hospitals. Extra Life was formed in 2008 to honor Victoria Enmon, who died of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The Children’s Miracle Network Hospitals® raise funds and awareness for 170 member hospitals that provide 32 million treatments each year to kids across the U.S. and Canada. Donations stay local to fund critical treatments and healthcare services, pediatric medical equipment and charitable care. <a href="https://www.charitynavigator.org/index.cfm?bay=search.summary&amp;orgid=5756">Extra Life has a charity score of 87.12 by the Charity Navigator</a>. Rather than feeding our cocaine habits, we’d ask that you consider giving to this charity instead.</p>

<h4 id="supporting-the-podcast">Supporting the podcast</h4>

<p>For anyone who does generously flip a schmeckle to us, <strong>first know that we really appreciate your support.</strong> Like, really appreciate it. Your support makes RallySec possible. We do this for you, and without you there’s not really a point. Without your interest, Ben would just be sitting quietly at home crocheting a nice sweatervest for his cats.</p>

<p>Second, supporting RallySec (through any means) allows us do this without having to sellout to corporate sponsors, change our format and content to be more corporate friendly, and potentially have to shill products that none of us really care about (we know its humans that make security work, not products).</p>

<p>For Season 2 and future seasons, I’m hoping to be able to put any generous donations to good use (now that we don’t have to pay Amazon) by professionalizing our recording equipment, by finding ways to contribute back to the community directly, and by paying contributors who put time and effort into educating and sharing their experiences and helping RallySec grow. If you’re feeling pinched financially, I and most of the RallySec hosts would rather you put your money towards getting a shake that makes your day better, or paying off college loans, or something that’s going to improve <strong>your</strong> quality of life. If you can’t donate financially, consider sharing a link to our podcast to help spread the word.</p>

<p>If you’ve gotten this far you must be really, really determined to give us money, so here are some ways you can support RallySec directly:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Donate via a PayPal subscription (This is the lowest overhead option, most of the $ actually goes towards us instead of to a third party)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.twitch.tv/subs/rallysecurity">Subscribe on Twitch</a> (cheapest if you have Amazon Prime, you get 1 free subscription per month)</li>
  <li><a href="https://www.patreon.com/rallysecurity">Support us via Patreon</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://amzn.to/31AKUGg">Use our Amazon Associates links</a></li>
</ul>

<p>RallySec is not sponsored by any of these companies we linked to, and we work hard to ensure we have little to no overhead so that we can keep doing RallySec as cheaply as possible. This allows us to speak freely about issues and topics that our sponsors might push back against.</p>

<p>Anyone who does donate to us directly will be listed on our intro and ending scenes during our streams and videos as seen below.</p>

<p>Thanks for helping making the community a better place!</p>
